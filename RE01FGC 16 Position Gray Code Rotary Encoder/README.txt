The RE01FGC is a compact, 16-position Gray Code rotary encoder module. It converts a 4 bit binary value generated by an onboard rotary switch into a 4-bit Gray Code output using three integrated XOR gates. The resulting output provides robust and clean signals, ideal for breadboard prototyping.

The module is designed to operate at 1.65 V and up to 5V logic levels, with clean signal transitions and convenient breadboard pin spacing, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and educational purposes. Each position on the rotary switch corresponds to a unique value in Gray Code value.

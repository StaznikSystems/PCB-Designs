The SPA1051B is a compact power adapter designed to connect a DC barrel jack to the power rails of a standard breadboard. 

It provides selectable output between the input voltage of up to 12V and regulated 5V using a physical slide switch. The compact 12.5x30 mm form allows it to fit in non intrusively. It is ideal for powering circuits during prototyping on breadboards.

The 5 V regulator integrates thermal shutdown protection, allowing it to be left on for extended periods of time at high power demands without risk of damage. In addition, the device has been designed with thermals in mind, featuring a high thermal mass, resulting in smaller temperature rises.
